Walter is a pure CSS design system based on sound typographic principles. It's intended for mainly for personal sites, or any site which prioritizes a pleasant reading experience over profit generation through ads or other user-unfriendly means.

Walter is incredibly easy to install and customize. It doesn't require any special tools, dependencies, or command line jockeying. All the classes used by Walter are prefixed (as form of namespacing), making it very easy to integrate in your site without breaking any existing CSS code, or code from third party libraries.
